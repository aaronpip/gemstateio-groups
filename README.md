# gemstateio-groups
Tech creative groups in Idaho with purpose, locations, and frequency

## Mission
### Foster connections between tech creatives in all parts of Idaho
This repository feeds the mission by providing updated and comprehensive data on tech "meetups" that transcend Idaho's internal boundaries. We want people meeting up and doing great things with reckless abandon.

Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Contributing
This repository has the most up-to-date descriptions, approximate locations, and recurrance/frequency of meetings. If you know a new group, see a bug in current group information, or one of the groups is sadly no more, please open an issue (https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/issues) or PR to fix it yourself!

Please see groups-schema.json, which you can use with http://csvlint.io, to check your work.

A group should have held one meeting and have a URL explaining date/time of future meetings. (We want groups that intend to meet frequently... no "first annuals.") The groups should be focused on any aspect of technology industry in Idaho, tech/STEM education, or 'hackfests' where cool stuff's being built. We'll be checking in to see if groups are still alive, an effort that takes time. Please open an issue if you have questions about what we might accept!
