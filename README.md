# gemstateio-groups

## Big picture

gemstate.io's mission is fostering connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho. We want to see people doing great things everywhere in Idaho, and they needn't do it alone.

gemstateio-groups is a dataset the https://gemstate.io agent treats as authoriative about names, locations, & URLs of "meetup" groups, .

## Edit the data!

Groups listed here:

- focus on creating things using technology in Idaho (e.g. specific-technology user groups, hack nights, initiative groups, continuing education, conferences, and tech-business groups)
- must have Idaho basis (are based in Idaho, or are in communities on the Idaho border.)
- livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC events with Idaho basis are accepted too, and we encourage groups that aren't doing this today to start doing it!
- must have a URL explaining why/when/what
- ideally uses one of the schema-listed technologies for event scheduling (e.g. Facebook) so gemstate.io can work its magic
