Tech creative groups in Idaho with frequency and location

## Mission
Foster connections between tech creatives in all parts of Idaho, here by providing updated and comprehensive lists of tech 'meetups' that transcend city/metro boundaries so people can meet up with reckless abandon. Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Contributing
This repository has the most up-to-date descriptions, approximate locations, and recurrance of group meetings. If you know of a new group, information can be improved for a current group, or one of the groups is no more, please open an issue or pull request!

## Acknowledgements
