# gemstateio-groups

## Big picture

gemstate.io's mission is fostering connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho. We want to see people doing great things everywhere in Idaho, and they needn't do it alone.

gemstateio-groups is a dataset the https://gemstate.io agent treats as authoriative about names, locations, & URLs of creator groups.

## Contributing

If you want to spread knowledge about a new group, or want to update a group's information, please submit a pull request against [groups.csv](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups.csv). See [groups-schema.json](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups-schema.json) if you're confused about the schema.

Groups listed here:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho
- Have Idaho basis (based in Idaho or on the border.) Livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC meetings with Idaho basis are good too!
- Should use either Meetup or Facebook for event scheduling so http://gemstate.io can work its magic
- Must have a URL explaining why/when/what
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what the group considers acceptable inclusive behavior. This should be easily discoverable at the URL.
