# gemstateio-groups

[gemstate.io](https://www.gemstate.io)'s mission is connecting people that create with 
technology in Idaho.

gemstateio-groups is the data the gemstate.io apps use for group names, locations, and events. 
See [groups.json](groups.json) and [its schema](groups.schema.json).

If you'd like to use this data in your own project, please do! It's public domain under [CC0](LICENSE).

## groups.csv is deprecated

Although the data was originally in CSV format, we've switched to
JSON, allowing for future extension and making changes easier to review. 
[groups.csv](groups.csv) is frozen for changes and we'll remove it completely
March 2019.

Please make your changes to [groups.json](groups.json) instead.
