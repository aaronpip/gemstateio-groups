# gemstateio-groups
Idaho's tech meetup data with purpose, location, frequency, and more. Please help us update it!

## Mission
gemstate.io's mission is to foster connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho. 

gemstateio-groups feeds the mission by providing data on tech meetups/conferences/hackathons happening in Idaho. 

We want people meeting and doing great things with reckless abandon, but they needn't do it alone. Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Get the data!

See [groups.csv](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups.csv). The schema is [groups-schema.json](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups-schema.json), which explains the meaning of some of the columns, and helps keep the data valid (try http://csvlint.io.)

Groups listed here:

- focus on creating things using technology in Idaho (e.g. hackathons, specific-technology user groups, initiative groups, continuing education, conferences, and tech-business groups)
- held 1 meeting already <sup>1</sup>
- have a URL explaining when future meetings are (or at minimum some contact point)
- have Idaho basis or border (notably Pullman and Spokane Valley) basis

Livestream/video-conference-only events with Idaho basis are great too, and we encourage groups that aren't doing this today to try it!

## Contributing
If you know of new groups, dead groups, or want to update a group's information, please [open an issue](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/issues) or pull request. Please validate changes using the schema.
