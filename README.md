Tech creative groups in Idaho with purpose, locations, and frequency

## Mission
### Foster connections between tech creatives in all parts of Idaho
This repository feeds the mission by providing updated and comprehensive data on tech "meetups" that transcend Idaho's internal boundaries. We want people meeting up and doing great things with reckless abandon.

Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Contributing
This repository has the most up-to-date descriptions, approximate locations, and recurrance/frequency of meetings. If you know a new group, see a bug in current group information, or one of the groups is sadly no more, please open an issue or pull request to fix the data!

Please see groups-schema.json, which you can use with http://csvlint.io, to check your work.

A group should have held one meeting already and have a URL explaining date/time of future meetings before we add it. (We want groups that intend to meet frequently so others can join in.) The groups should be focused on the technology industry in Idaho, 'hackfests', or education sessions. We'll be checking in on groups to see if they're still alive, an effort that takes time! Please open issues for questions.
