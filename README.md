# gemstateio-groups
Idaho tech group data with purpose, location, frequency, and more

## Mission
gemstate.io's mission is to foster connections between tech creatives in all parts of Idaho. This repository feeds the mission by providing updated and comprehensive data on tech "meetups" and groups that transcend Idaho's internal boundaries. We want people meeting and doing great things with reckless abandon.

Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Contributing
This repository (will have) the most up-to-date descriptions, approximate locations, and recurrance/frequency of meetings. But we need your help to keep it that way! 

If you know a new group, know a group's disbanded, or want to update a group's data, please open an issue (https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/issues) or pull request. Please see SCHEMA.md for more information about our data.

Groups should have held 1 meeting and have a URL proposing a future meeting: we want groups that intend to meet frequently... no "first annuals."<sup>1</sup> Groups should focus on any aspect of technology innovation and industry in Idaho, tech education, or 'hackfests' where cool stuff's built, not just talked about. We do encourage livestream & video conference groups! We'll be checking in to see if groups are still alive, an effort that we expect will take some time and care, and we think these rules will help.

## Footnotes
