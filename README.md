Tech creative groups in Idaho with frequency and location

## Mission
Foster connections between tech creatives in all parts of Idaho. This dataset helps with the mission by providing a frequently updated and comprehensive list of tech 'meetups' that transcend city/metro boundaries so people can meet up and do (or just talk) with reckless abandon. 

Reckful abandon is also OK.

We'd like to see fewer accidental collisions and overlaps ("I want to go to DangularJS but it's the same night as Webfoo.") We'd like to see intentional collision and overlap, as smaller groups are recognized and larger groups churn.

## Contributing
This repository has the most up-to-date descriptions, approximate locations, and recurrance of group meetings. If you know of a new group, information can be improved for a current group, or one of the groups is no more, please open an issue or pull request!

Please see groups-schema.json for the information we're looking for.

Groups must have a website about next meeting, should have 4 confirmed attendees, before we add it, and be focused on technology industry and education. Someone will be checking in on groups to see if they're still alive, an effort that takes time for each group in our list, and contributors thank you in advance for not listing World of Warcraft guilds here. Spin a tech meetup group off your World of Warcraft guild and we'll talk!
