# gemstateio-groups
Tech creative groups in Idaho with purpose, locations, and frequency

## Mission
### Foster connections between tech creatives in all parts of Idaho
This repository feeds the mission by providing updated and comprehensive data on tech "meetups" that transcend Idaho's internal boundaries. We want people meeting up and doing great things with reckless abandon.

Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Contributing
This repository has the most up-to-date descriptions, approximate locations, and recurrance/frequency of meetings. But we need your help to keep it that way! 

If you know a new group, see a bug in current group information, or one of the groups is sadly no more, please open an issue (https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/issues) or PR to fix it yourself! If you modify groups.csv directly please see groups-schema.json, which you can use with http://csvlint.io, to check your work.

Groups should have held one meeting and have a URL explaining date/time of future meetings: we want groups that intend to meet frequently... no "first annuals." Groups should be focused on any aspect of technology industry in Idaho, tech/STEM education, or 'hackfests' where cool stuff's built. We'll be checking in to see if groups are still alive, an effort that we expect will take some time and care, and we think these rules will help. If you wonder if a group would be accepted please open an issue to ask!
