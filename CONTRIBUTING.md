Please submit pull requests with your changes to [groups.csv](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups.csv). See [groups-schema.json](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups-schema.json) if you're wondering about the columns.

Groups listed here:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho
- Have Idaho basis (based in Idaho or on the border.) Livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC meetings with Idaho basis are good too!
- Should use public Meetup.com or public Facebook group for event scheduling so gemstate.io can work its magic (an iCalendar/ics URL also works, but doesn't support RSVP yet)
- Must have a URL explaining what the group's about (a Meetup.com/Facebook URL often suffices for this)
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what the group considers acceptable inclusive behavior. This should be easily discoverable at the URL.
